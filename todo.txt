new config vars:
- evolution type ("adaptive, neutral")
- S_0 weights [0,1]
  - probability that S_0[i] = 1
- GRN positive bias [0,1]
  - probability that nonzero A[i,j] = 1
- Selection Method ("anneal," "positive")



sim_functions:
- create ancestor
  - add weights to S_0 generation
  generate_random_grn
    - add weights to grn generation

- neutral_walk:
  - add break to walk if equilibrium reached

- adaptive_walk (copy of neutral_walk)

- run_sim:
  - add condition for adaptive evolution
    - adaptive_walk
